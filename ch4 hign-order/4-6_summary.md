# Summary

This chapter is one of the most important in the book. It didn't cover any new language features. Instead, we learned how to use some of the existing features in ways that might be new, surprising, or challenging. Higher-order programming and the Abstraction Principle are two ideas that will help make you a better programmer in any language, not just Ocaml. Of course, languages do vary in the extend to which they support theses ideas, with some providing significantly less assistance in writing higher-order code--which is one reason we use OCaml in this course.

Map, filter, fold and other functionals  are becoming widely recognized as excellent ways to structure computation. Part of the reason for that is they factor out the <i>iteration</i> over a data structure from the computation do at each element. Languages such as Python, Ruby, and Java 8 now have support for this kind of iteration.
